For over 20 years, I have dedicated my career to conducting biomedical research, spanning from basic and pre-clinical research to observational clinical studies.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I am passionate about data-driven approaches with the long-term goal of advancing diagnostics and helping develop new, personalized therapies, particularly for patients with inborn errors of immunity or complex immunological diseases. In addition, I am interested in HLA immunogenetics, large-scale antibody profiling, and infectious disease research. I aim to use insights from systems approaches to better understand human immune variation in health and disease.

<br>
<br>
<h3>Other Interests</h3>
- Creating educational content and teaching.
- International development and global health.
- Developing software tools and applications for data analysis and gaining insights.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Past Positions and Postdoctoral Training</h3>
- Principal Investigator at <a href="{{ 'https://www.sidra.org/' }}">Sidra Medicine</a>, leading research on the biological and clinical consequences of human germline genetic variation and inborn errors of immunity.
- Postdoctoral Fellow / Research Associate at <a href="{{ 'https://bcchr.ca/' }}">BC Children's Hospital Research Institute</a> and briefly at the <a href="{{ 'https://centerforvaccinology.ca/' }}">Canadian Center for Vaccinology</a>, focusing on immune defenses in neonates and young children against respiratory viral infections.
- Postdoctoral Fellow / Research Associate at the <a href="{{ 'https://www.ubc.ca/' }}">University of British Columbia</a>.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Education</h3>
I obtained my doctoral degree from the <a href="{{ 'https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/' }}">University of WÃ¼rzburg</a>, conducting dissertation research at the <a href="{{ 'https://www.ubc.ca/' }}">University of British Columbia</a>, where I also began my early postdoctoral training. During that time, my research focused on immune evasion strategies of <i>Bordetella pertussis</i>, the causative agent of whooping cough.
