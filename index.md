Hi there! I'm Nico Marr, and this is my personal website. 

I'm a biologist, conducting research in immunology, microbiology, virology and human genetics. In recent years, I have also developed a passion for data science and machine learning.

I maintain this website to share things I'm working on. Here you can find links to all my <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}">publications</a>, <a href="{{ '/tutorials/' | relative_url }}">tutorials</a>, <a href="{{ 'en/teaching/' | relative_url }}">courses</a> I'm developing/teaching, and other resources.

To learn more about me, check out my <a href="{{ '/about/' | relative_url }}">About</a> page.
