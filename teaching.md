I provide professional training for biomedical research institutions and corporate clients, with a special focus on supporting researchers in resource-limited settings.

### LLM Training for Biomedical Researchers

I'm developing a practical course to help biomedical researchers harness Large Language Models (LLMs) in their scientific work. **Available starting early 2026.**

**Course Details:**
- 2-3 months with live lessons and virtual office hours
- Hands-on exercises with real research scenarios
- Focus on responsible LLM use in research contexts
- Options for reduced-cost access for qualifying individuals and institutions

**What You'll Learn:**
- Integrating LLMs into literature review and research workflows
- Context engineering for scientific tasks
- Building custom workflows with API integration
- Systematic evaluation of LLM-generated outputs
- Ethical considerations and responsible use
